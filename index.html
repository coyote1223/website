			I feel very confident in coding with Java. After earning two very challenging Oracle certifications,
			I am looking for a job to deepen my programming skills, learn other technologies and continue to grow as a person.
			The ability to understand and learn complex concepts quickly helps me to overcome difficult challenges and reach my goals. 
			</p>
			<p class="aboutMeParagraph">
			The goal I want to achieve is to become a Full Stack Developer. So yes, I am highly interested in learning 
			a lot of technologies. Through my non-technical background I have developed confidence and communication

					Ranging from Associate, Professional, Expert to Master level, Oracle Certified Professional
					is the second toughest Java exam that Oracle offers. After I passed the Oracle Certified Associate
					exam, I instantly decided to start preparing for this exam. Studying was far from easy while working
					at a non-tech job. Still, after thirteen very challenging months of self-study, I passed the exam, earned
					this Oracle credential, and most importantly I learned a lot on the journey. <br><br>
					A word from Oracle: "By passing the required exam, a certified individual proves tremendous fluency 
					in Java SE and acquisition of the valuable professional skills required to be a Java software developer."<br><br>

					After studying and fighting with Java in the first couple of months 
					of my programming journey I found out that Oracle offers Java certifications
					which instantly draw my attention. Becoming an officialy certified Java programmer was
					my new goal. I passed this for me at that time surprisingly tough exam and earned the 
					credential. <br><br>
					A word from Oracle: "The Java SE 8 Oracle Certified Associate certification helps you build a 
					foundational understanding of Java, and gaining this certification credential is the first of two steps in 
					demonstrating you have the high-level skills needed to become a professional Java developer."<br><br>

			<div class="matrixDropDown">
				<p class="project1Paragraph">Small desktop application that does not serve any purpose,
					but still has functionalities and allows the user to manipulate 
					the outcome by pressing or clicking certain keys on the keyboard. 
					In the begining, I only had the idea of outputting random numbers
					on the GUI but after building that I added even more functions to it.
					When the program runs the user sees the instructions and after 
					pressing 'OK' the Matrix begins to output the numbers. 
				</p>
				
				<img src="images/matrixInstructions.png" alt="matrix1" class="matrixImages">
					
				<p class="project1Paragraph">It is probably the most simplest way of showing how multithreading works.
					While one thread is constantly printing the numbers, the user can press
					keys and instantly change the way the program behaves. User has the 
					ability to increase and decrease the speed, delete whole output, 
					stop and continue the program and more. 
				</p>
				
				<img src="images/matrix1.png" alt="matrix1.jpg" class="matrixImages">
				
				<p class="project1Paragraph">The last idea that came to my mind while building this program was
					to give the user the ability to press and hold one number and output
					only that number in the whole program. As there are a lot of ways to do this, 
					I decided to do it with the help of functional programming. The power of 
					Streams in Java, is that it enabled me to find the number the user is pressing
					with only 4 lines of code.

					in Java helped me understand code in JavaScript and PHP which I then gladly 
					took to my advantage. The drop-down buttons that you clicked to see these project
